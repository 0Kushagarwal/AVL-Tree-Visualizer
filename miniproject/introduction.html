    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p class="def">AVL Tree or <i class="name">Adelson-Velsky and Landsis Tree</i> is a type of self balancing binary
        search
        tree. The AVL
        Tree is named after its two soviet inventores named <i class="name">Georgy Adelson-Velsky</i> and <i
            class="name">Evgenii Landsis</i>.</p>
    <h2>Key Points :- </h2>
    <p>
    <ul class="about">
        <li>The height difference between left nodes and right nodes of AVL Tree should not be greater than 1 or less
            than -1.</li>
        <li>The range of the height difference must lie within the domain [-1,1] and be of type natural number.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Characterstics :- </h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>AVL Tree is a type of Binary Search Tree so it follows all the properties of the Binary Search Tree.</li>
        <li>Each subtree of the tree is balanced which states that the height difference between the left and right node
            must lie in a range of [-1, 1].</li>
        <li>The tree balanced itself at the time of insertion or deletion of any node which makes insertion and deletion
            process time consuming.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Advantages :- </h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>AVL Tree can self balanced and gives us time complexity of O(log n) for searching, insertion and deletion of
            a node.</li>
        <li>It is a BST so the items can be traversed in a sorted way.</li>
        <li>AVL Tree in general have relatively less height and hence searching is faster.</li>
        <li>AVL Tree is relatively less complex to understand and implement as compared to few types of trees.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Disadvantages :- </h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Compared to BST it is difficult to implement.</li>
        <li>Due to its stict balanced nature, the insertion or deletion of a node takes more number of rotations.</li>
    </ol>
